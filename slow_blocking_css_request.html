		<h1>Slow Blocking CSS Request</h1>

		<p>This page is slow to load because of a slow CSS file in the header. That's because CSS is <em>render blocking</em>.</p>

		<p>Prevent this by ensuring that CSS files are as small and fast to download as possible.</p>
			
		<p>Consider inlining CSS for <em>above the fold</em> markup in the &lt;head&gt; and load an additional CSS file for <em>below the fold</em> content.</p>

		<p>Render-blocking is intentional - what good is your site without CSS? (Demo <em>flash of unstyled content - FOUC</em>).</p>
